# R-Program-Challenges
R Program Challenges for my Essex graduate summer school course and my University of Michigan undergraduate data science course. 

These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.

Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits. Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step. You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course. Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course. Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

I have tried to provide informative file names. R_Challenge_ is the first part of each file name. The next part specifies the primary structure or concept that the challange is designed to teach to students (e.g. vector, matrix, analysis, probability, simulation, text, etc.). The final part of the the file name is designed to be a description or analogy of the task. So for example, R_Challenge_vector_sqrt_search.R is a challenge designed to used vectors made with the sequence function seq() in R to find the square root value for any real number.
