## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge:
##
## (1a) Write a program to create a numeric vector of any n size (you choose n arbitarily or randomly).
## (1b) Determine the length of the vector, save this value as an object.
## (1c) How many coordinates in the vector are even? Save this value as an object.
##
## (2a) Create a numeric matrix of equal size which is square (i.e., m==n).
## (2b) Determine the size of the dimensions of the matrix, save these values as a single object.
## (2c) How many coordinates in the matrix are made of only even numbers? Save this value as an object.
##
## (3a) Create a numeric array of 3 dimensions of equal size.
## (3b) Determine the size of the dimensions of the array, save these values as a single object.
## (3c) How many coordinates in the array are made of only even numbers? Save this value as an object?
##
## (4a) Write a function to repeat the process described in (3).
## (4b) Write a function to repeat the above process for an array of a pre-determined dimension of equal size (hint: start with a pre-defined number of dimensions).
##
## (5a) Calculate the relationship between the size of the vector/matrix/array from above and compare it to the number of coordinates that have only positive values.
## (5b) How does this value change as a function of the dimensions of the array? Does this value change when the size of the vector/matrix/array changes?
##
## Note: this next part is difficult in R but less so in some other programming languages.
##
## (6) Can this process be extended to an array of arbitrary size? Can you write a function to complete this task?
