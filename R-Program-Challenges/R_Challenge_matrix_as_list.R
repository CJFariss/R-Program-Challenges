## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge
##
## (1) Write a program to generate an MxN matrix of random size (randomly choose M and N).
##
## (2) Fill the matrix with the numbers 0 or 1 (or up to any integer value will work too).
## (3) Convert the matrix to a list object so that each row in the matrix becomes a numeric vector in the list.
## (4) Remove all of the 0s from each element of the list.
##
## (5a) Calculate the row sums of the matrix.
## (5b) Calculate the sum of values in each vector contained in the list.
## (5c) Calculate the length of the list vectors.
##
## (6a) Calcuate the difference between the row sums in the matrix and the length of the vectors in the list.
## (6b) Calcuate the difference between the matrix row lengths and the list vector lengths.
##
## (7a) Write a simulation that repeatedly completes steps (2) - (6) and save the differences in a numeric vector.
## (7b) Create a function to complete (7a).
##
## (8) Graph and summarize the values in the differences vector created in step (7a).
