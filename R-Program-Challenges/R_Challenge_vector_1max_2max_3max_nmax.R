## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge
##
## (1) Create a numeric vector of arbitrary length.
##
## (2) Determine the maximum value in the vector.
##
## (3) Determine the position in the vector at which() the maximum resides (if there is a tie, report both positions).
##
## (4) Determine the second largest max value in the vector.
##
## (5) Report the position in the vector at which() the maximum resides (if there is a tie, report both positions).
##
## (6) Repeat the same process for the third max value.
##
## (7) Write a program that generalizes this process for any number of max values up to the length of the vector.
##
## (8) Write a function using the program writtin in step (7). "Wrap" the program from step (7) in a function.
##
## (9) Think about the output of the function in (8), now write a new function that generalizes this process for two vectors of the same length that preserves the order of the first vector relative to the second (hint: you'll look for the max values of the second vector for each group of equal values from the first vector).
##
## (10) generalize the function for step (8) for any number of columns (or the total number of columns that are of equal length)
