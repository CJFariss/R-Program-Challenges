## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge
##
## (1) Write a program to generate a m * n matrix of 1s and 0s, where m=n.
##
## (2) Determine how many square-submatrices have all 1s. The square submatrices can be as small as 1-by-1. These are symmetric matrices that occupy contiguous coordinates inside the matrix). Some examples: A 2-by-2 submatrix will have 5 submatrices (four: 1-by-1 matrices and one: 2-by-2 matrix). A 3-by-3 matrix will have 14 submatrices (nine: 1-by-1 matrices; four: 2-by-2 matrix; and one 3-by-3 matrix)
##
## (3) Determine the count of each square submatrices of different size.
##
## (4) change the program so that it can repeate stepts (1) - (4) for non-symetric matrices, such that m != n. 
##
## (5) Write a function to complete these programming tasks.
##
## Warning: this step is harder until we get to the data visualization unit in week 13.
##
## (5) Write a program to graphically display the results from (2) and (3). Hint: use a barplot().
