## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge
##
## (1) generate a character string
## (2) count the number of uniques characters in the string
## (3) sort the character string based on frequency of each of the characters
## (4) create a program that generalizes (1) and (3) to work on a vector of character strings
## (5) create a new string of characters that are removed from the strings before the sort
## (6) create a function to implement the steps above
## (7) create another function to implement the steps above for a vector of character strings, this time count the number of unique words instead of characters
##
## These next steps go beyond the material covered in the course (be wary but have fun):
##
## (8a) download and install the twitteR library: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/twitteR/versions/1.1.9
## (8b) create a developer account at twitter (this is necessary to get the twitteR package to access the tweeter API)
## (9) obtain a vector of tweets for a world leader's twitter account (e.g., the President of Senegal @Macky_Sall; or Human Rights Watch @hrw)
## (10) use your function from (7) to count the unique terms across all the tweets you have obtained
## (11) Create an Rplot of the most freqent words
## (12) Create an Rplot of the number of tweets over time
