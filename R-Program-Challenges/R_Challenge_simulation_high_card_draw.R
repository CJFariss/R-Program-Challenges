## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge:
##
## (1) As a character vector, define a deck or cards that ranges from "2" to "Ace" so that all of the standard cards are present as character strings (don't worry about suits, so just 13 cards).
##
## (2) Generate another vector that contains the coordinates for the character vector created in step (1), this will also be of length 13.
##
## (3) Program a draw of 5 cards from the deck of cards vector at random (hint: use the sample function in the base library or your shuffle function).
##
## (4) Program two draws of cards to player1 and player2 (hint: use 10 of the 13 cards, for 5 cards in player1's deck and player2's deck).
##
## (5) Determine with a logical statement which player has the highest card.
##
## (6) Simulate a series of games between player1 and player2, who wins the most often?, does either player have an advantage?
##
## (7) Write a function to accomplish (1) - (5).
##
## (8) Write a separate function to accomplish (6).
##
## (9) Combine the functions created in (7) and (8).
