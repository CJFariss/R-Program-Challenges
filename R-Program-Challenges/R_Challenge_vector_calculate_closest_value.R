## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge
##
## (1) Create a numeric vector (let's call the object we create x or vec) of a length greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 (i.e., 2 < n <= 5).
##
## (2a) Select an arbitrary value. What is the distance between this value and the numeric values in the vector?
## (2b) Select another arbitrary value What is the distance between this value and the numeric values in the vector? Is it close or further away from the values in the vector than the arbitray value selected in step (2a)?
##
## (3) What is the closest number to the values in the vector created in step (1)?
